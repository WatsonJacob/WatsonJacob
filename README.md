Hello world! My name is Jacob Watson and welcome to my GitHub profile. 
<br>Hopefully the work you've seen here (or will see in the future) will be very interesting because I am not. I'm about as average or plain as a person could be.<br>
<br>As far as future plans go, I'm gonna try to apply myself in classes for Information Tech since the Computer Science concentration was a bit rough.<br>
<br>Hobbies: Reading, learning to play various instruments, getting into film and TV, and hopefully I can restart hiking here sometime in the future. <br>
