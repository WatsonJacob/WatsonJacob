<br> Classes are recorded and posted online. That doesn't mean don't show up but you can refer back to it if needed. <br>
<br> This class seems like it might be pretty tough - don't mess around! <br>
<br> Class next week will be in Room 125 so we can get started immediately. <br>
<br> Check D2L frequently for class news and info. <br>
<br> Enable mobile notifications (still make manual checks). <br>
<br> This class uses C# as it's language. Hopefully it won't be as crazy as Data Structures. <br>
<br> Code documentation is key - remember Mr. Hall's wife. <br>
<br> We're gonna use GitHub for everything. <br>
<br> Abstraction is the most important part of this course. Understand it! <br>
<br> Join ACM? <br>
<br> Looks like feedback will be extensive - use it to improve <br>
<br> Notes go to dropbox (wrote that but so far it goes here actually). <br>
<br> A portion of points will be given back for corrections. <br>
